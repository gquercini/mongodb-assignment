# Lab. Assignment. MongoDB

## The Dataset

The dataset that we are using consists of 
a MongoDB collection with 88 documents.
Each document corresponds to a movie, described by 
the following attributes: title, year,
genre, summary, country,  director
and actors.
The value of the attribute director is  a document that describes
an artist with the following attributes: first_name,
last_name, birth_date and role.
The value of the attribute actors is a list of 
documents, each describing an artist.
The values of all the other attributes are strings.

# Preliminaries

You will need to have Docker installed on your computer.
If it is not the case, please [click on this link](https://store.docker.com/). 

In order to use MongoDB, you will need to:

1. Launch a MongoDB server.
2. Import the data into the database.
3. Launch a MongoDB client. 

The client queries the database through the server over a network.

Open a terminal (Windows users: Command Prompt or PowerShell, but not PowerShell ISE)
and create a directory named mongo-assignment with the following command:

```
mkdir mongo-assignment
```

Move to that directory with the following command:

```
cd mongo-assignment
```

Create a new directory named data with the following command:

```
mkdir data
```

Download the file moviesEmbedded.json and place it
in the directory data.

### Launch a MongoDB server

First, create a network, so as the client and the server can 
communicate, with the following command.

```
docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

Then launch a MongoDB server with the following command (make sure you are connected to the Internet).

```
docker run -d --name mongodb-server --network app-tier bitnami/mongodb:latest
```

### Import the data

In order to import the data, run the following command:

```
docker run --mount type=bind,source=data,target=/home/data -it --rm --network app-tier bitnami/mongodb:latest mongoimport --db movie --collection moviesEmbedded --drop --jsonArray --file  /home/data/moviesEmbedded.json  --host mongodb-server
```

This will create a database named movie containing a collection named moviesEmbedded.

### Launch a MongoDB client

To launch a MongoDB client, run the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm --network app-tier bitnami/mongodb:latest mongo --host mongodb-server
```

The client is a simple command-line interface where you can type in the queries.

## Queries

By using the command-line interface of the client, type the following command to connect 
to the database movie

```
use movie
```

Write and run the following queries:

1. The movies titled "Gladiator".
2. The distinct genre values of movies.
3. The movies of "crime" or "drama" genre.
4. The list of movies directed by "Hitchcock",display only title and year andsort them by year.
5. The list of movies where "Cotillard" played.
6. The movies released between 1967 and 1995.
7. The list of the movies released between 1967 and 1995, by displaying only title, year, directorâ€™s last name sorted by year. 
8. The number of movies by country.
9. The number of movies by country and actor.
